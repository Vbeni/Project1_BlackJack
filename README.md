## How to Play
The game will deal two cards to both the player and dealer. <br>The player can then choose to "Hit" to draw another card, or "Stay" to end their turn. </br>
<br>The dealer will then draw cards until they reach a total of 17 or higher, at which point the game will end and a winner will be declared.</br>
<br>The winner is determined by the player and dealer hands' values, with the goal being to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over.</br>
<br>Click on the "New Game" button to start a new round.</br>
